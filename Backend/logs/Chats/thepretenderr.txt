05-23 18:19:> <dabolink> lol
05-23 18:46:> <ianzhougaming> hello again
05-23 18:47:> <ianzhougaming> man i just did a 6 and a half hour stream, and it was the craziest stream i had ever done
05-23 18:53:> <ianzhougaming> i start off with 94 follower and gain 2 new follower in a span of 1 minute, than slowly i start to gain more follower and viewer. eventually i reach 100 by the 3rd hour. than there was 15 people watching my stream near the 4th hour. and then for unknown reason my pc crash and i was so upset because there were 13 people watching my stream the moment my pc crash :(. when i did comeback i only manage to hit 7 viewer at most. and then when i switch my game to fsx, there was 14 people watching me and i gain 7 new follower in a span of 90 minutes. but all in all i gain 13 follower in a span of 6 and a half hour. i even ban someone from the channel for posting link
05-23 18:53:> <ianzhougaming> i know it's a wall of text
05-23 18:54:> <ianzhougaming> but it was like a roller coaster ride
05-23 18:56:> <ianzhougaming> well it was the second time i got double digit new follower in a session for my stream, the first time was also crazy because i gain 9 follower in a span of 60 minute and i was playing fsx at 1:00 am in the morning
05-23 18:57:> <ianzhougaming> i know right at 1:00 am in the morning i didn't know many people still watch that game
05-23 19:00:> <ianzhougaming> fsx streamer are mostly americans and they tend to stream in the afternnon and early evening and have a lot of viewer, but i guess when you stream at midnight and they're not on, people tend to watch my channel
05-23 19:00:> <ianzhougaming> but the thing is i'm not a overnight streamer, and i done it twice and it was like hell when i did the stream
05-23 19:01:> <ianzhougaming> barely have any energy to talk to the viewer

05-23 21:00:> <ianzhougaming> losing streak hype
05-23 21:00:> <ianzhougaming> actually that's not a hype , that's devastating' 
05-23 21:00:> <dabolink> he's use to it
05-23 21:01:> <ianzhougaming> if this was fifa i would been destroy every chair i have in my room by now
05-23 21:02:> <dabolink> play league of legends poorly*
05-23 21:02:> <dabolink> dude i have over 50% win rate
05-23 21:02:> <dabolink> its like 55 atm
05-23 21:03:> <ianzhougaming> nah i'm kidding , i played fifa since 2010, so i'm use to the bs scripting and giving up 90th minute goal
05-23 21:03:> <dabolink> you dont have over 1200 games
05-23 21:04:> <dabolink> its a lot harder to keep a higher percentage over time
05-23 21:04:> <dabolink> yes, cause you play against other people of a higher level....
05-23 21:04:> <dabolink> thats how matchmaking works
05-23 21:04:> <dabolink> it gets closer to a 50/50
05-23 21:04:> <dabolink> as you play
05-23 21:05:> <dabolink> ... that makes no sense....
05-23 21:06:> <dabolink> lim x->infitity of wins / games = 50%
05-23 21:06:> <ianzhougaming> but believe or not, in fifa if you lose it's better to lose 5-0 or 6-0 than 2-1 or 1-0 because if you lose in a blow out, you don't care after 3 or 4-0 and you just want to move on to the next game, but if you lose close game, it such a heart break and it can get into your head in the next game
05-23 21:07:> <infernodes78> ok well ima go bye time for anime

05-25 21:02:> <ianzhougaming> <3 <3 <3
05-25 21:02:> <ianzhougaming> it's not the symbol for sure

05-25 21:05:> <ianzhougaming> if betting is illegal in the us, than vegas would not exist
05-25 21:06:> <ianzhougaming> would is there casino i canada
05-25 21:06:> <ianzhougaming> i sure there is
05-25 21:07:> <ianzhougaming> because if betting is illegal in a country than casino would not exist
05-25 21:09:> <ianzhougaming> which is why if a country think gambling is illegal and casino built on reserved land, the government will do anything to buy that reserve land
05-25 21:10:> <ianzhougaming> the government always have tons of money 
05-25 21:10:> <ianzhougaming> and for those that doesn't have a strong goverment than there lucky
05-25 21:12:> <ianzhougaming> although there isn't a lot of place with a bad government, and the place that do people are more worry about employment and housing more than gambling and building casino on reserve land

05-25 23:05:> <yukichama> i moved my bb captain into the us premium ships i had and would get him about 100k xp in 4 matches
05-25 23:06:> <yukichama> my best match with x5 xp was 25.6k or so
05-25 23:07:> <yukichama> had those 50% xp flags saved
05-25 23:10:> <yukichama> need to catch the iowa's while hes broadside cause his armor is thinner then yours but its better angled
05-25 23:10:> <yukichama> i can tank yamato's in the iowa as long as i stay angled nose on to him
05-25 23:14:> <yukichama> so far i wouldn't recommend any of the premium ships
05-25 23:14:> <yukichama> the atlanta is the best of them i feel
05-25 23:15:> <jrkyex> !dabolinkbot
05-25 23:15:> <dabolinkbot> dabolinkbot is superior to non-bots
05-25 23:15:> <yukichama> atlanta is good for dd hunting with 16 5" guns but aside from that its kinda meh
05-25 23:16:> <yukichama> i tried out almost all of them cause at open beta reset ill get all hte gold tokens back
05-25 23:17:> <yukichama> ur gonna get torped
05-25 23:21:> <yukichama> lol iowa shooting he
05-25 23:22:> <yukichama> means he can't aim and reallies on steady damage and fire
05-25 23:23:> <yukichama> ur aim isn't to horrible its ur awareness of where your ships going while in combat thats hurting u
05-25 23:25:> <yukichama> it did about 15k
05-26 00:05:> <raskalian> hey tyler
05-26 00:05:> <raskalian> terruble, natasha didnt show up so i had to work an additional shift as soon as i got home from school
05-26 00:05:> <raskalian> plus they fired her so i have to take her shift tommorow as well
05-26 00:05:> <raskalian> pain
05-26 00:06:> <raskalian> not  nice, one day off this week now
05-26 00:06:> <raskalian> fuck money
05-26 00:06:> <raskalian> i want sleep
05-26 00:07:> <raskalian> jealous, i gotta wait another hour to clean my work clothes, and then wake up at 5 am to get ready for school
05-26 00:07:> <raskalian> thats every night this week for me 
05-26 00:08:> <raskalian> tommorow im off at 9:30 but i have a 6 hour practice with evil geniuses afterwards
05-26 00:08:> <raskalian> doubt ill sleep at all tommorow night
05-26 00:08:> <raskalian> subbing
05-26 00:08:> <raskalian> and dont get paid unless i play a winning match
05-26 00:09:> <raskalian> dota doesnt pay salaries
05-26 00:09:> <raskalian> they get paid in tourny winning
05-26 00:09:> <raskalian> swinnings*
05-26 00:09:> <raskalian> winnings*
05-26 00:09:> <raskalian> its not league
05-26 00:10:> <raskalian> dota has huge tournament prize pools but noone gets paid just to be on a team, league players are paid salaries for pro, plus whatever they get from tournaments
05-26 00:10:> <raskalian> no, the top 15 highest paid gamers are dota 2 international winners
05-26 00:11:> <raskalian> but starting out in league is alot better for subs cause at least they get a salary
05-26 00:11:> <raskalian> well lets see, the average amount of money for a large, non international tourny in dota is around 2mill
05-26 00:11:> <raskalian> and international gives out a total of around 20million to all the gamers
05-26 00:12:> <raskalian> im not making shit up
05-26 00:12:> <raskalian> 20mill prize pool for last international
05-26 00:12:> <raskalian> and 2mill for dota asian championships and the summit and dreamhack
05-26 00:13:> <raskalian> i dunno the numbers for league at all
05-26 00:13:> <raskalian> to google i go
05-26 00:13:> <raskalian> nvm ur right, league pays more total
05-26 00:13:> <raskalian> average player makes around 100k per year just off salary
05-26 00:13:> <raskalian> theres alot of pro league teams
05-26 00:13:> <raskalian> thats alot of cash
05-26 00:14:> <raskalian> i guess league is probably better for the slightly worse players, who still get paid just to play
05-26 00:14:> <raskalian> and dota is better for the highest skilled players
05-26 00:14:> <raskalian> cause winner of international gets like 70% of the prize pool
05-26 00:15:> <raskalian> evens out in the end
05-26 00:15:> <raskalian> but probs slightly more money from league

05-28 00:04 :> <ianzhougaming> yeah so why didn't hitler won the war
05-28 00:04 :> <ianzhougaming> <3 <3
05-28 00:04 :> <haladslader> !userstats
05-28 00:04 :> <dabolink> !friendship
05-28 00:04 :> <ianzhougaming> we didn't  even attack the soviet
05-28 00:04 :> <ianzhougaming> it was a indirect war fare
05-28 00:04 :> <raskalian> he vastly overestimated the power of his army, most of the world ganged up on him, and they were many attempts on the inside to bring down their army
05-28 00:04 :> <ianzhougaming> so that doesn't count as a real attack on the soviet
05-28 00:05 :> <ianzhougaming> which make him dumb
05-28 00:05 :> <raskalian> the only reason they didnt attack the soviet union, was because the us wouldve lost just as much in the war
05-28 00:05 :> <raskalian> mutually assured destruction
05-28 00:05 :> <ianzhougaming> the war was about stopping communist not attacking soviet
05-28 00:06 :> <raskalian> are we now talking about the cold war?
05-28 00:06 :> <ianzhougaming> yep
05-28 00:06 :> <raskalian> k good, just making sure
05-28 00:06 :> <ianzhougaming> not the stupid world war ii
05-28 00:06 :> <raskalian> well we started on ww2
05-28 00:06 :> <raskalian> so just making sure we on the same page
05-28 00:06 :> <ianzhougaming> which hitler was the reason it started
05-28 00:07 :> <ianzhougaming> north carolina= mercedes amg
05-28 00:07 :> <raskalian> okay, if we are debating this legit, i dont agree with what hitler did or his reasons for it, but u cannot say that he was a stupid leader
05-28 00:07 :> <ianzhougaming> still  <3 <3 4 life
05-28 00:07 :> <ianzhougaming> he was stupid because he think world domination is possible
05-28 00:08 :> <raskalian> his only major mistake was attacking the soviet union too early
05-28 00:08 :> <ianzhougaming> the only think he did good is to get out germany from depression
05-28 00:08 :> <ianzhougaming> and that's it
05-28 00:08 :> <raskalian> he shouldve waited to take the rest of europe before challenging the soviet union
05-28 00:09 :> <ninjakid574> i am getting more corn to eat
05-28 00:09 :> <raskalian> mmmm corn
05-28 00:09 :> <ianzhougaming> otherwise he hated jews, he like big gun, and he try to build a nuclear bomb 
05-28 00:09 :> <ianzhougaming> but of course we were the one the was able the atomic bomb first
05-28 00:10 :> <raskalian> well  if he had succeeded at gettiing the bomb first, then we wouldve been fucked cause in the hands of hitler, there wouldve been no mercy
05-28 00:10 :> <ninjakid574> corn butter and salt yummm
05-28 00:10 :> <raskalian> got lucky that the americans had a little heart after they saw what they did to japan and stopped

06-03 15:57 :> <ianzhougaming> good afternoon, the betting company is now open again
06-03 15:58 :> <ianzhougaming> or maybe the kart is this game is undriveble 
06-03 15:59 :> <ianzhougaming> no that what people say about the kart in this game
06-03 16:00 :> <ianzhougaming> they say it's undriveble once you put the traction is off
06-03 16:01 :> <ianzhougaming> these kart in this game seem very unrealistic 
06-03 16:03 :> <ianzhougaming> here a tip stay out of the tarmac or ripple strip it will instanly spin you out 
06-03 16:04 :> <ianzhougaming> touch it and it's gg
06-03 16:04 :> <ianzhougaming> rip rip  osbury osbury
06-03 16:05 :> <ianzhougaming> are you playing carrer mode
06-03 16:05 :> <ianzhougaming> i'm assuming you are sice you playing with kart
06-03 16:06 :> <ianzhougaming> can't wait to see how you do in a race
06-03 16:06 :> <ianzhougaming> probably rip
06-03 16:06 :> <ianzhougaming> and the bet line of one spin out is 1 of 1.00000000000001
06-03 16:07 :> <ianzhougaming> don't touch the strip
06-03 16:07 :> <ianzhougaming> or rip
06-03 16:07 :> <ianzhougaming> and spinout
06-03 16:08 :> <ianzhougaming> winning odd 6 to 1
06-03 16:08 :> <ianzhougaming> it's a gentle odd line because the ai kart in this game is horrible
06-03 16:08 :> <ianzhougaming> as long as if  you stay in fornt no way they catch you
06-03 16:09 :> <ianzhougaming> as long as you don't be in a pack of kart
06-03 16:09 :> <ianzhougaming> then you will be doom
06-03 16:10 :> <ianzhougaming> once you get out of kart life doesn't get easier
06-03 16:11 :> <ianzhougaming> also this game is start to died out
06-03 16:12 :> <ianzhougaming> not as many viewer watch this as it was about 4 weeks ago
06-03 16:12 :> <ianzhougaming> which is not surprise because most race car game last two month on twitch before no one will stream it
06-03 16:12 :> <ianzhougaming> just like grid autosport
06-03 16:14 :> <ianzhougaming> the only racing game that is still going strong on twitch is forza horizon 2 
06-03 16:15 :> <ianzhougaming> never a fan of console
06-03 16:15 :> <ianzhougaming> i more of a simulator guy
06-03 16:16 :> <ianzhougaming> and last time i check there really very little simulation game on console
06-03 16:16 :> <ianzhougaming> the only simulation game i know on console is farming simulator
06-03 16:17 :> <ianzhougaming> the only game i like to play on console is fifa 15, and gta v
06-03 16:17 :> <ianzhougaming> depend what simulation game your playing
06-03 16:18 :> <ianzhougaming> like euro truck is a great simulation game to play  because many people like driving a truck with a wheel
06-03 16:19 :> <ianzhougaming> whereas you have some stupid simulation game like tea party simulation is certainly not a ligit simulation
06-03 16:19 :> <ianzhougaming> but then again the only reason why euro truck is still so probably is because of the mods
06-03 16:20 :> <ianzhougaming> is there no mods that game would easily died out after a month or two
06-03 16:20 :> <ianzhougaming> goat simulator is not a simulator
06-03 16:20 :> <ianzhougaming> the only reason why people buy that game is for the fun, but after an hour it's get hell of boring
06-03 16:21 :> <ianzhougaming> which is why now is the best time to buy that game because steam has a refund system now, buy the game play for an hour and a half and return it
06-03 16:23 :> <ianzhougaming> speaking of brake don't break your wheel  \:-?d
06-03 16:24 :> <ianzhougaming> also i forgot to introduce my   \&lt\;3 to all
06-03 16:24 :> <ianzhougaming> what???!!!

06-03 16:28 :> <ianzhougaming> lolol your driving a caterham
06-03 16:28 :> <ianzhougaming> caterham car sucks
06-03 16:28 :> <ianzhougaming> it's not for racing
06-03 16:29 :> <ianzhougaming> catheram= 10000000x slower than the prosche
06-03 16:31 :> <ianzhougaming> yeah but what if someone is from britain
06-03 16:31 :> <ianzhougaming> or austrilla
06-03 16:31 :> <ianzhougaming> are they dumb

06-05 20:43 :> <ianzhougaming> but it's not called the monaco circuit because of copy rights reason

06-07 21:02 :> <infernodes78> soo i can do anything..
06-07 21:02 :> <ianzhougaming> it's going to be tough because fsx is a very boring game
06-07 21:02 :> <infernodes78> i could even bang my girl..
06-07 21:03 :> <infernodes78> do it for warframe/fix
06-07 21:03 :> <infernodes78> fsx*
06-07 21:03 :> <infernodes78> i'm just joking..
06-07 21:03 :> <ianzhougaming> and when you have no one support you it will be even more challenging
06-07 21:03 :> <infernodes78> i'll join the stream tomorrow but yeah..
06-07 21:04 :> <ianzhougaming> especially 90% of the stream will be mostly in mid air 
06-07 21:04 :> <ianzhougaming> and once you in mid air  it turn into a waiting game
06-07 21:04 :> <infernodes78> my friend told me that he hasn't texted his gf for a long time and then she texted him to get his attention and said fmina..
06-07 21:04 :> <infernodes78> fmima*
06-07 21:04 :> <infernodes78> which means..
06-07 21:05 :> <infernodes78> well if u want me to say.
06-07 21:05 :> <ianzhougaming> i did a 5 hour stream yesterday, and i was glad to get some support
06-07 21:05 :> <ianzhougaming> because for the first 2 hour the stream was like dead
06-07 21:05 :> <ianzhougaming> no one watch, and the one do watch never chat
06-07 21:05 :> <infernodes78> if u want me to say what fmima means just tell me yes or no..
06-07 21:05 :> <topez64> tyler you should play never winter, world of tanks, and team fortress 2
06-07 21:05 :> <infernodes78> cuz its um
06-07 21:06 :> <infernodes78> tf2 is awesome
06-07 21:06 :> <infernodes78> also fmima means fuck me in my asshole..
06-07 21:06 :> <infernodes78> that's why my friend got texted by his gf
06-07 21:06 :> <haladslader> ......................................................
06-07 21:06 :> <infernodes78> just saying..
06-07 21:06 :> <ianzhougaming> but my recipe of streaming is that even if no one watching your stream, you just need to keep streaming and hope someone will show up
06-07 21:07 :> <infernodes78> ok i'm not gonna show up in ur stream ian just to make unmasked
06-07 21:07 :> <infernodes78> u mad*
06-07 21:07 :> <infernodes78> i would play games with u but i'm sorta 3 hours ahead of u
06-07 21:08 :> <ianzhougaming> and that what i did i went from 3 viewer to 10 and climb up all the way to the second most viewer in fsx during the time i was streaming
06-07 21:08 :> <infernodes78> or however many hours
06-07 21:08 :> <topez64> i finally came around to go farm for my zephyr
06-07 21:08 :> <ianzhougaming> but i think people will come to my stream tomorrow since people always come to stream that has the title 12 hour stream
