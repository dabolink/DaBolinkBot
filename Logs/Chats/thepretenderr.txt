05-23 18:19:> <dabolink> lol
05-23 18:46:> <ianzhougaming> hello again
05-23 18:47:> <ianzhougaming> man i just did a 6 and a half hour stream, and it was the craziest stream i had ever done
05-23 18:53:> <ianzhougaming> i start off with 94 follower and gain 2 new follower in a span of 1 minute, than slowly i start to gain more follower and viewer. eventually i reach 100 by the 3rd hour. than there was 15 people watching my stream near the 4th hour. and then for unknown reason my pc crash and i was so upset because there were 13 people watching my stream the moment my pc crash :(. when i did comeback i only manage to hit 7 viewer at most. and then when i switch my game to fsx, there was 14 people watching me and i gain 7 new follower in a span of 90 minutes. but all in all i gain 13 follower in a span of 6 and a half hour. i even ban someone from the channel for posting link
05-23 18:53:> <ianzhougaming> i know it's a wall of text
05-23 18:54:> <ianzhougaming> but it was like a roller coaster ride
05-23 18:56:> <ianzhougaming> well it was the second time i got double digit new follower in a session for my stream, the first time was also crazy because i gain 9 follower in a span of 60 minute and i was playing fsx at 1:00 am in the morning
05-23 18:57:> <ianzhougaming> i know right at 1:00 am in the morning i didn't know many people still watch that game
05-23 19:00:> <ianzhougaming> fsx streamer are mostly americans and they tend to stream in the afternnon and early evening and have a lot of viewer, but i guess when you stream at midnight and they're not on, people tend to watch my channel
05-23 19:00:> <ianzhougaming> but the thing is i'm not a overnight streamer, and i done it twice and it was like hell when i did the stream
05-23 19:01:> <ianzhougaming> barely have any energy to talk to the viewer

05-23 21:00:> <ianzhougaming> losing streak hype
05-23 21:00:> <ianzhougaming> actually that's not a hype , that's devastating' 
05-23 21:00:> <dabolink> he's use to it
05-23 21:01:> <ianzhougaming> if this was fifa i would been destroy every chair i have in my room by now
05-23 21:02:> <dabolink> play league of legends poorly*
05-23 21:02:> <dabolink> dude i have over 50% win rate
05-23 21:02:> <dabolink> its like 55 atm
05-23 21:03:> <ianzhougaming> nah i'm kidding , i played fifa since 2010, so i'm use to the bs scripting and giving up 90th minute goal
05-23 21:03:> <dabolink> you dont have over 1200 games
05-23 21:04:> <dabolink> its a lot harder to keep a higher percentage over time
05-23 21:04:> <dabolink> yes, cause you play against other people of a higher level....
05-23 21:04:> <dabolink> thats how matchmaking works
05-23 21:04:> <dabolink> it gets closer to a 50/50
05-23 21:04:> <dabolink> as you play
05-23 21:05:> <dabolink> ... that makes no sense....
05-23 21:06:> <dabolink> lim x->infitity of wins / games = 50%
05-23 21:06:> <ianzhougaming> but believe or not, in fifa if you lose it's better to lose 5-0 or 6-0 than 2-1 or 1-0 because if you lose in a blow out, you don't care after 3 or 4-0 and you just want to move on to the next game, but if you lose close game, it such a heart break and it can get into your head in the next game
05-23 21:07:> <infernodes78> ok well ima go bye time for anime

05-25 23:05:> <yukichama> i moved my bb captain into the us premium ships i had and would get him about 100k xp in 4 matches
05-25 23:06:> <yukichama> my best match with x5 xp was 25.6k or so
05-25 23:07:> <yukichama> had those 50% xp flags saved
05-25 23:10:> <yukichama> need to catch the iowa's while hes broadside cause his armor is thinner then yours but its better angled
05-25 23:10:> <yukichama> i can tank yamato's in the iowa as long as i stay angled nose on to him
05-25 23:14:> <yukichama> so far i wouldn't recommend any of the premium ships
05-25 23:14:> <yukichama> the atlanta is the best of them i feel
05-25 23:15:> <jrkyex> !dabolinkbot
05-25 23:15:> <dabolinkbot> dabolinkbot is superior to non-bots
05-25 23:15:> <yukichama> atlanta is good for dd hunting with 16 5" guns but aside from that its kinda meh
05-25 23:16:> <yukichama> i tried out almost all of them cause at open beta reset ill get all hte gold tokens back
05-25 23:17:> <yukichama> ur gonna get torped
05-25 23:21:> <yukichama> lol iowa shooting he
05-25 23:22:> <yukichama> means he can't aim and reallies on steady damage and fire
05-25 23:23:> <yukichama> ur aim isn't to horrible its ur awareness of where your ships going while in combat thats hurting u
05-25 23:25:> <yukichama> it did about 15k
05-26 00:05:> <raskalian> hey tyler
05-26 00:05:> <raskalian> terruble, natasha didnt show up so i had to work an additional shift as soon as i got home from school
05-26 00:05:> <raskalian> plus they fired her so i have to take her shift tommorow as well
05-26 00:05:> <raskalian> pain
05-26 00:06:> <raskalian> not  nice, one day off this week now
05-26 00:06:> <raskalian> fuck money
05-26 00:06:> <raskalian> i want sleep
05-26 00:07:> <raskalian> jealous, i gotta wait another hour to clean my work clothes, and then wake up at 5 am to get ready for school
05-26 00:07:> <raskalian> thats every night this week for me 
05-26 00:08:> <raskalian> tommorow im off at 9:30 but i have a 6 hour practice with evil geniuses afterwards
05-26 00:08:> <raskalian> doubt ill sleep at all tommorow night
05-26 00:08:> <raskalian> subbing
05-26 00:08:> <raskalian> and dont get paid unless i play a winning match
05-26 00:09:> <raskalian> dota doesnt pay salaries
05-26 00:09:> <raskalian> they get paid in tourny winning
05-26 00:09:> <raskalian> swinnings*
05-26 00:09:> <raskalian> winnings*
05-26 00:09:> <raskalian> its not league
05-26 00:10:> <raskalian> dota has huge tournament prize pools but noone gets paid just to be on a team, league players are paid salaries for pro, plus whatever they get from tournaments
05-26 00:10:> <raskalian> no, the top 15 highest paid gamers are dota 2 international winners
05-26 00:11:> <raskalian> but starting out in league is alot better for subs cause at least they get a salary
